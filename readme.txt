
Evaluation

The goal of this project was to use the data collected to determine which features made cars more valuable.

With the data you collected, we have narrowed down the most critical aspects of a used car value to be age, odometers, cylinders, condition of the car, and drive with salvage cars having the lowest overall value.

Included are two graphs showing how the price decrease as the odometer increases and age increases. Please read further for more recommendations on drive, cylinders, and condition.


In the analysis, we have excluded data for special purchases such as collector or high value sports cars. These should be evaluate separately. Without the data regarding purchase price, time on lot, and negotiation changes, this data cannot be linked to which cars will provide the most profit.


Evaluating the car data itself, there was some incorrectly formatted data on manufacture, model, and drive (rw, fw, 4w, aw). This would need to be more precisely defined/entered to determine if there are any trends in these areas.  We did see a slight uptick on 4w drive and expect a similar uptick on aw drive if selected correctly. See box plot included.
​

The more used the car is (with the exception of the classic models) the lower the price as indicated by age, condition, and odometer. This meets the expectation we discussed in the initial review. Evidence indicated salvaged cars had a higher impact on price than either of us expected with "fair" condition also triggering a low response. From the data, you can see "excellent", "like new" and "good" were lower than new but there may be some judgement differences. I recommend the sales teams align on common terms for these values. See "images/condition boxplot.png".


​Next Steps

Next steps recommended are as follows:

* Align on a common frame work for condition. This should be measureable such as mechanical or appearance metrics that are not subjective.
* Add data regarding gas mileage
* Correct data regarding make, model, drive and manufacture year
* Add sales data such as date of sales, discounts, advertising/sales used to set sales price

Pending the improved data, you can assume that cars that are newer, in good or better condition, and have low odometer will have higher value with some preference to 4w drive. While cars that are salvage or poor condition will have lower value.
